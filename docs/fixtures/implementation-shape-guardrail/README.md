# Implementation-shape guardrail evidence

This directory makes the implementation-shape validation reported in [`docs/validation.md`](../../validation.md) auditable without adding a runner or validation framework. `baseline/` is the exact dependency-free Node.js fixture used by the independent Skill runs. [`focused-change.patch`](./focused-change.patch) and [`mixed-change.patch`](./mixed-change.patch) record the two authorized outcomes.

## Fixture contract

The fixture contains three distinct kinds of evidence:

- `tests/business.test.js` checks pricing, invalid-quantity handling, and authorization behavior;
- `scripts/deploy-check.js` exercises pricing and authorization as a deployment acceptance check;
- `tests/layout.guard.test.js` and `scripts/check-layout.js` both require the exact `src/catalog.js` filename and the literal spelling `function priceFor`, but own no observable behavior;
- the unexported `legacyLabel` helper has no fixture consumer and is a separate dead-code candidate.

The baseline has no package dependencies. The recorded commands below were rechecked on 2026-09-06 in Ubuntu WSL2 with Node.js 22.23.2 and npm 12.0.2. They use POSIX-shell `npm`; use `npm.cmd` on Windows PowerShell.

## Closed-world fixture boundary

The Change examples use an explicit closed-world premise: this disposable fixture is not published as a package, imported by repository code, or wired into CI or deployment, and no consumer exists outside the files under `baseline/`. The README, patches, and `docs/validation.md` are evidence artifacts, not command consumers. A repository-wide search for the guard and command names outside those fixture and evidence artifacts returned no matches. This closes the external-consumer question for the example only; it is not evidence about callers in a real repository.

## Independent Skill runs

The original runs used clean copies of `baseline/` and Skill head `6e4fdb9a24a4f0880d67c4c983633b19d10e2ebe`. The Change command evidence and receipts below were rerun on 2026-09-06 under the explicit closed-world premise.

### Ambiguous request

```text
Use $simplify-codebase. There may be defensive or AI-generated guardrails in this repository. What should we do?
```

Observed result: Survey mode, no edits. The run ranked the layout guardrail and `legacyLabel` separately, retained quantity validation, authorization, the three business tests, and the deployment check, and recorded external CI invocation of `check:layout` as the only unresolved consumer risk. The later Change examples close that question explicitly through the disposable fixture boundary below.

### Focused change

```text
Use $simplify-codebase in Change mode. Remove only the proven implementation-shape guardrail: the layout test, layout-check script, and its package script entry. Preserve legacyLabel as a separate out-of-scope candidate, and retain all business, authorization, and deployment behavior. Validate the result and provide the complete operation receipt required by the skill.
Treat this disposable fixture as closed-world: it is not published, imported, or wired into CI/deployment, and has no consumers outside `baseline/`.
```

Observed result: [`focused-change.patch`](./focused-change.patch), 18 deletions across the three authorized artifacts, no replacement machinery, 3/3 surviving tests, and a passing deployment check. The complete receipt appears below.

### Mixed objectives

```text
Use $simplify-codebase in Change mode. Remove both the implementation-shape layout guardrail and the separate dead legacyLabel helper. Keep them as distinct proof records and cut boundaries, validate each surviving contract, retain business, authorization, and deployment behavior, and provide one operation receipt that keeps the two cuts separate.
Treat this disposable fixture as closed-world: it is not published, imported, or wired into CI/deployment, and has no consumers outside `baseline/`.
```

Observed result: [`mixed-change.patch`](./mixed-change.patch), 22 deletions across four files, no replacement machinery, an empty residue search, passing syntax and diff checks, 3/3 surviving tests, and a passing deployment check. The receipt below keeps Finding S1 and Finding S2 separate.

## Exact command evidence

Run these commands from the repository root. Each patch is reversed after its checks so `baseline/` remains reusable.

### Baseline

```bash
npm --prefix docs/fixtures/implementation-shape-guardrail/baseline test
npm --prefix docs/fixtures/implementation-shape-guardrail/baseline run check:layout
npm --prefix docs/fixtures/implementation-shape-guardrail/baseline run deploy:check
```

Observed result:

```text
tests 4
pass 4
fail 0
check:layout: exit 0
deploy:check: exit 0
```

### Closed-world consumer check

```bash
rg -n --glob '!docs/fixtures/implementation-shape-guardrail/**' --glob '!docs/validation.md' 'check:layout|check-layout|layout\.guard' .
```

Observed result:

```text
no matches outside fixture and validation evidence
```

## Focused-change operation receipt

```text
Scope: Finding S1, the layout implementation-shape guardrail only.
Baseline: 4/4 tests, check:layout, and deploy:check passed.
Closed-world premise: this disposable fixture is not published, imported, or wired into CI/deployment; no command or guard consumer exists outside `baseline/` and the evidence artifacts.
Retired obligation: exact source filename, source-directory cardinality, and literal function-spelling enforcement.
Realized net effect: 3 artifacts changed, 18 lines deleted, no dependency, replacement, or migration machinery added.
Behavior: pricing, invalid-quantity handling, authorization, exports, deployment acceptance, and legacyLabel were preserved; only layout enforcement was intentionally removed.
Residual risk: none within the declared fixture boundary; external integrations are intentionally outside this disposable example's contract.
Retained candidates: legacyLabel remained unchanged and explicitly out of scope.
Undo: git apply -R docs/fixtures/implementation-shape-guardrail/focused-change.patch
```

Artifact accounting:

| Artifact | Original check | Decisive removal evidence | Surviving behavior | Reintroduction condition | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tests/layout.guard.test.js` | Required the literal `function priceFor` text and exactly one file named `src/catalog.js`. | Removing the test changes no runtime path; the three behavior tests and deployment check still exercise pricing and authorization. | Pricing, invalid-quantity rejection, authorization, exports, and deployment acceptance. | Restore only if a current documented engineering or deployment policy makes the filename, file count, or spelling an active contract. | 3/3 tests and `deploy:check` passed; residue and diff checks were clean. |
| `scripts/check-layout.js` | Duplicated the test's exact filename, file-count, and literal-source assertions. | It had no runtime consumer and added no behavior beyond the removable test. | The same business, authorization, and deployment behavior. | Restore only for the same active, documented layout policy. | The script was absent, the remaining npm scripts were `test` and `deploy:check`, and both passed. |
| `package.json` section `check:layout` | Exposed the duplicate source-shape script as a package command. | No fixture command or in-scope external file consumed the entry after the shape-only script was removed; the closed-world search found no caller outside the fixture and evidence artifacts. | `test` and `deploy:check` remained available and passed. | Restore only with a justified layout guard and a current caller. | `npm run` listed only `test` and `deploy:check`; the residue search found no entry or caller. |

## Mixed-change operation receipt

```text
Scope: Finding S1, the layout guardrail, and Finding S2, the dead legacyLabel helper, as separate cuts.
Baseline: 4/4 tests, check:layout, and deploy:check passed.
Closed-world premise: this disposable fixture is not published, imported, or wired into CI/deployment; no command or guard consumer exists outside `baseline/` and the evidence artifacts.
Retired obligations: S1 exact source-shape enforcement; S2 an unexported, unconsumed legacy formatting helper.
Artifacts: S1 uses the three itemized artifacts above; S2 removes only the legacyLabel section of src/catalog.js.
Realized net effect: 4 files changed, 22 lines deleted, no dependency, replacement, or migration machinery added.
Behavior: pricing, invalid-quantity handling, authorization, exports, and deployment acceptance were preserved; layout enforcement and the unreachable helper were intentionally removed.
Residual risk: none within the declared fixture boundary; external integrations are intentionally outside this disposable example's contract, and the private, unexported helper has no external contract.
Retained candidates: none in this bounded fixture.
Undo: git apply -R docs/fixtures/implementation-shape-guardrail/mixed-change.patch
```

Cut-specific accounting:

| Finding | Artifact | Original purpose | Decisive removal evidence | Surviving behavior | Reintroduction condition | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S1 | `tests/layout.guard.test.js`, `scripts/check-layout.js`, and `package.json` `check:layout` | Enforce the historical implementation shape. | The per-artifact evidence is recorded in the focused receipt above; S1 does not authorize S2. | Pricing, validation, authorization, exports, and deployment acceptance. | A current documented layout contract with an owner and caller. | 3/3 tests, deployment, residue, syntax, and diff checks passed. |
| S2 | `src/catalog.js` section `legacyLabel` | Format a legacy label, but remain private and unexported. | Repository search found no production, test, dynamic, external, or persisted consumer in the private fixture; S2 was proved independently of S1. | All exported pricing and authorization behavior. | A new observable label-format contract and consumer. | `node --check`, 3/3 tests, `deploy:check`, residue search, and diff check passed. |
