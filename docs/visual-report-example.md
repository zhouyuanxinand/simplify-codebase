# Cleanup Map handoff example

This is a format example, not a finding about a real repository. Replace every
placeholder with verified facts and absolute artifact paths from the current
run. The written proof record remains authoritative. These examples assume the
user requested or confirmed visual delivery; otherwise deliver the complete
text report without generating the map.

## Survey

```text
Coverage: entrypoint, coordinator, worker lifecycle, state publication, tests
Blind spot: external plugin consumers were not available

Finding index
S1 · ranked · high confidence · <repo>/src/job-state.ts:<line>
     Duplicate readiness representation across one ownership boundary
     Locate: survey-cleanup-map.html#finding=S1&stage=locate
     Trace:  survey-cleanup-map.html#finding=S1&stage=trace
     Cut:    survey-cleanup-map.html#finding=S1&stage=cut

Finding ID: S1
Candidate: merge the legacy readiness flag into the canonical lifecycle state
Locus: JobRuntime; <repo>/src/job-state.ts:<line>; <repo>/src/publisher.ts:<line>
Topology: primary legacyReady; related worker, lifecycleState, legacyReady, publisher; confirmed route worker to publisher; cut legacyReady and its synchronization relationships
Burden: two representations must be synchronized before publication
Reachability: runtime publisher reads both; tests cover both; external plugins unresolved
Rationale: the flag predates the canonical lifecycle state; no current decision record owns both
Cut: declaration, write path, publication branch, dedicated fixture, and stale documentation
Consequence: the legacy readiness representation is no longer available
Confidence / risk: high repository confidence; external plugin uncertainty prevents Change authority
Proof: a publication test that fails if completion is emitted before canonical terminal state
Net effect: one state representation and one synchronization branch retired; no replacement layer

Visual companion: delivered
Reason: S1 spans four confirmed runtime concepts and is easier to locate as a cleanup decision map
Specification: <artifact-directory>/survey.cleanup-map.json
Artifact: <artifact-directory>/survey-cleanup-map.html
Finding links: S1 -> #finding=S1&stage=trace and #finding=S1&stage=cut
Evidence level: authored confirmed relationships
Validation: PASS cleanup-map contract validation; PASS all seven artifact checks
Visual review: passed at 1280x800 and 1440x900 after inspecting Locate, Trace, Cut, node passport, and route probe
Limitations: source links omitted because the example is not revision-pinned
```

Generate the artifact with the bundled renderer:

```bash
node <skill-root>/visualization/render-cleanup-map.mjs deliver \
  <artifact-directory>/survey.cleanup-map.json \
  <artifact-directory>/survey-cleanup-map.html
```

Lower-ranked, rejected, and unresolved Findings still belong in the text report
even when the map visualizes only the top five.

## Change

```text
Scope: JobRuntime lifecycle ownership boundary
Baseline: <commands and pre-existing failures>
Retired obligation: legacy readiness representation and synchronization branch
Artifacts: <exact changed and generated files>
Realized net effect: one state, one branch, one fixture, and one documentation obligation removed
Behavior: completion remains gated by the canonical terminal state
Verification: <residue, decisive, local, repository, boundary, and diff results>
Residual risk: <untested or external boundaries>
Retained candidates: <items kept and reasons>
Undo: <exact files or commit range and restoration steps>

Visual companion: delivered
Reason: the cut removes one state owner and reroutes publication to the surviving source
Specification: <artifact-directory>/change.cleanup-map.json
Artifact: <artifact-directory>/change-cleanup-map.html
Finding links: S1 -> #finding=S1&stage=before, #finding=S1&stage=cut, #finding=S1&stage=after, and #finding=S1&stage=verify
Evidence level: authored confirmed relationships
Validation: PASS cleanup-map contract validation; PASS all seven artifact checks
Visual review: passed at 1280x800 and 1440x900 after comparing Before, Cut, After, and Verify
Limitations: the uncommitted After snapshot is not revision-pinned; the map does not prove runtime correctness
```

If an implementation changes only local code inside one stable component, use
`Visual companion: skipped` and explain that no meaningful relationship context
changed. The Change operation receipt remains mandatory.
